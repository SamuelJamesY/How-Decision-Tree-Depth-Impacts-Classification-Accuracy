# How-Decision-Tree-Depth-Impacts-Classification-Accuracy

It was explored how depth of a decision tree impacted classification accuracy. Too shallow a decision
tree resulted in underfitting to the training dataset whilst too deep a decision tree resulted in overfitting 
to the training dataset. For each tree depth from 1 to 10 layers, 10 experiments were undertaken and the 
mean and standard deviation were recorded. The train test split used was 75/25 and the minimum samples per leaf 
was set to 3.
